# Lynx Fund

**Exchange-Traded Fund analysis — costs, holdings, allocation, performance, risk.**

Part of the [Lince Investor Suite](https://github.com/borjatarraso/lynx-dashboard).

## Scope

Strictly **Funds only**. Stocks, mutual funds, closed-end funds, and index
funds are rejected at the resolver level with a clear error. Use
`lynx-fundamental` for stocks.

## Install

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Quickstart

```bash
lynx-fund -p SPY                     # Production analysis (uses cache)
lynx-fund -p QQQ --refresh            # Force fresh data
lynx-fund -p IE00B4L5Y983             # Analyze by ISIN (IWDA UCITS)
lynx-fund -p -s "world equity"        # Search for ETFs
lynx-fund -p -i                       # Interactive REPL
lynx-fund -p -tui                     # Textual TUI
lynx-fund -p -x                       # Tkinter GUI
lynx-fund --explain expense_ratio     # Explain a metric
```

## Verdict

Every analysis produces a 0-100 scored verdict across five categories
(Costs, Liquidity, Performance, Diversification, Risk) with strengths,
risks, and a "suitable for" recommendation.

## Modes

All four Suite modes are supported:

- **Console** (default) — one-shot Rich-rendered report
- **Interactive** (`-i`) — REPL prompt
- **TUI** (`-tui`) — Textual full-screen
- **GUI** (`-x`) — Tkinter window

Every mode honours the Lince Investor Suite themes (including the
Bloomberg-dark `lynx-theme` default).

## Data sources

- **yfinance** — price history, fund info, holdings, allocation
- **yfinance Search** — ISIN → ticker resolution

"""Educational tips for passive fund investors.

The display layer renders these in a final ``Tips for Passive Investors``
panel after the analysis. Tips fall into two buckets:

* **Universal** — buy-and-hold rules of thumb every passive investor
  should internalise, independent of the fund being analysed.
* **Tailored** — generated from the report itself (e.g. "this fund is
  Irish-domiciled, so 15% withholding on US dividends applies").

Tips are deliberately short (one-liners), opinionated, and reference
the source (Bogle / Vanguard / academic consensus) where it helps the
reader trust the heuristic.

UNIVERSAL_TIPS: tuple[str, ...] = (
    # Cost
    "Cost is the single most reliable predictor of long-term return — "
    "every basis point of TER compounds against you for decades (Sharpe, 1991).",
    "Total cost of ownership = TER + bid-ask spread + tracking error. "
    "Compare all three before switching funds, not just headline TER.",
    "Mid-cap and small-cap index TERs are higher than large-cap; benchmark "
    "your fund against peers covering the same segment, not against SPY.",

    # Tax & domicile (huge for European investors)
    "US-domiciled ETFs charge 15% US withholding on dividends for treaty "
    "countries; Irish-domiciled UCITS charge 15% too thanks to the US-IE "
    "treaty — but European-domiciled non-Irish funds often suffer ≥30%.",
    "Accumulating share classes compound dividends inside the fund — best "
    "for tax-deferred / ISA / IRA accounts. Distributing classes pay out — "
    "best when you need income or live in a country that taxes notional "
    "accumulating income (e.g. UK reporting funds).",
    "US ETFs issuing K-1 (commodity / partnership) are more tax-painful "
    "than 1099 ETFs; if avoidable, prefer ETFs that issue 1099s.",

    # Distribution & compounding
    "If you reinvest dividends manually inside a Distributing fund, you "
    "lose the compounding benefit unless your broker offers a free DRIP.",
    "Capital-gain distributions are the silent tax drag of poorly-managed "
    "ETFs; a fund that historically pays them out is structurally less "
    "tax-efficient.",

    # Replication
    "Physical full replication > stratified sampling > synthetic / swap "
    "for buy-and-hold investors. Synthetic ETFs concentrate counterparty "
    "risk in a swap counterparty — fine if disclosed and well-collateralised, "
    "a problem if neither.",
    "Securities-lending revenue is fine for an investor when ≥85% of it "
    "is returned to the fund. Below that, the issuer is keeping a tax "
    "you didn't agree to pay.",

    # Liquidity & closure
    "Look at the *underlying* basket's liquidity, not just the fund's: an "
    "illiquid ETF tracking a liquid index can still be cheap to trade via "
    "creation/redemption. The reverse is much worse.",
    "ETFs under $50M AUM close more often than they don't. Verify the "
    "issuer's stated AUM growth or pick a peer fund with $1B+.",
    "Avoid trading at market open and close — bid-ask spreads widen. "
    "Use limit orders during the middle of the trading day.",

    # Risk
    "Cap-weighted indexes drift toward concentration during bull runs "
    "(see the Magnificent 7 in S&P 500). Equal-weight or fundamental-weight "
    "alternatives diversify but cost more.",
    "Tracking error tells you how faithfully the fund follows its index; "
    "tracking *difference* tells you whether the fund beat or trailed it.",
    "A volatile ETF is not a riskier investment for a 30-year passive "
    "holder — sequence-of-returns risk only matters if you sell during a drawdown.",
    "Rebalance once a year, not monthly. Frequent rebalancing increases "
    "transaction cost without measurable performance benefit (Vanguard, 2010).",

    # Behavioural
    "Past performance does not predict future returns; cost, structure, "
    "and diversification are the only durable signals at the fund level.",
    "Don't compare a small-cap ETF to SPY on Sharpe alone — risk-adjusted "
    "metrics need same-segment benchmarks.",
    "Time in the market beats timing the market. The biggest risk to "
    "passive investors is themselves.",

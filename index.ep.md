# Lynx Fund

> Analyze mutual funds

🟠 **PAUSED** · last touched **15 June 2026** (last commit)

## What this is

**Exchange-Traded Fund analysis — costs, holdings, allocation, performance, risk.**

Part of the [Lince Investor Suite](https://github.com/borjatarraso/lynx-dashboard).

Strictly **Funds only**. Stocks, mutual funds, closed-end funds, and index funds are rejected at the resolver level with a clear error. Use `lynx-fundamental` for stocks.

Every analysis produces a 0-100 scored verdict across five categories (Costs, Liquidity, Performance, Diversification, Risk) with strengths, risks, and a "suitable for" recommendation.

All four Suite modes are supported:

- **Console** (default) — one-shot Rich-rendered report
- **Interactive** (`-i`) — REPL prompt
- **TUI** (`-tui`) — Textual full-screen
- **GUI** (`-x`) — Tkinter window

Every mode honours the Lince Investor Suite themes (including the Bloomberg-dark `lynx-theme` default).

- **yfinance** — price history, fund info, holdings, allocation
- **yfinance Search** — ISIN → ticker resolution
- **Yahoo Finance + Google News RSS** — fund-level news
